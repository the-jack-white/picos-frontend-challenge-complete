# Picos Frontend Assessment

We would like to gather an understanding of how you code a simple page.

Picos is all about gathering information for network commissioners to select radio programmes and podcasts for broadcast. Our challenge to you is to create a short form for a production team to fill in with information about their programme or podcast (known as a Proposal).

## The task

Using the barebones app found in the `/src` folder, create a page that will allow a user to input the below information, and then display a confirmation message when they click the submit button. Instead of having the data sent to an API, simply have it printed in the console. We have put together some basic components that loosely follow the design language we use internally. These can be found in `/src/components`.

Capture the following information in the form:

- Proposal title (A short piece of text, just a title)
- Proposal summary (this will be a longer piece of text, multiple paragraphs perhaps.)
- Intended network (One of Radio 1, Radio 2, Radio 1Xtra, Radio 3, Radio 4, Radio 5 Live, Radio 6Music)
- Price per episode (Currency in GBP)

### Bonus
If you have time, and feel up to the task, add a way to validate the form input to ensure that every field has been populated with content and the price field is a valid format.

--- 
You should spend no more then a couple of hours on the task. It doesn't matter if you don't complete it - we just want to get a feel for how you approach things.
